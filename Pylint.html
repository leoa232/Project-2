          <h2 align=center>Pylint Tips</h2>

         <p> Pylint provides a simple way to analyze Python code, and its high configurability is easy to make a unified code style. This article will explain how Pylint will specify the Python code through theoretical introduction and example analysis.

Pylint is a Python Code Analysis Tool that analyzes the error in the Python code, finds code that does not meet the code style standard and potential problem.

Pylint is a Python tool that provides more features in addition to the role of the usual code analysis tool: if the length of the code 
line code is checked, whether the variable name meets the naming standard, and a declared interface is truly realized.</p>

<p>
  
 <h3 align=center>How to Use Pylint to check a module Module.py:</h2>

<br>1. Enter the folder where this module is located, run

<br>pylint [options] module.py
<br>This way of calling is always working because the current working directory is automatically added to the Python path.

<br>2. Do not enter the folder where the module is located, run

<br>pylint [options] directory/module.py
<br>This call mode is when it is satisfied when it is satisfied: Directory is a python package (such as a __init__.py file), or Directory is added to the Python search path.
 

<br>

<h3 align=center>Use Pylint to code a package Pakage:</h3>

<br>1. Enter the folder where this package is located, run

<br>pylint [options] pakage
<br>This way of calling is always working because the current working directory is automatically added to the Python path.

<br>2. Do not enter the folder in the package, run

<br>pylint [options] directory/ pakage
<br>In this case, it is possible to satisfy the following conditions: Directory is added to the Python path. For example, on Linux, export pythonpath = $ pythonpath: Directory.

<br>In addition, for the machine installed the Tkinter package, you can open a simple GUI interface using the command pylint-gui,
<br>enter the module or package name (rule to the command line), click Run, Pylint's output will be displayed in the GUI.</p>


            <h2 align=center>Glossary of Terms</h2>
            <h4>Factory</h4>
            <br>Factory Method is a creational design pattern 
            used to create concrete implementations of a common
            interface.It separates the process of creating an 
            object from the code that depends on the interface 
            of the object.
            <h4>Class</h4> 
            <br> A class is a code template for creating objects. 
            Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them.
             In python a class is created by the keyword class. 
            An object is created using the constructor of the class. 
            This object will then be called the instance of the class.
            <h4>Namespace</h4>
            <br> A namespace is a system that has a unique name for each and every object in Python.
             An object might be a variable or a method.
            <h4>Constructor</h4>
            <br>Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object.
             The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the
            data members of the class when an object of the class is created. 
            <h4>Fixture</h4>
            <br> Fixtures are functions, which will run before each test function to which it is applied.
             Fixtures are used to feed some data to the tests such as database connections, URLs to test
           and some sort of input data. 
            <h4>Type Hint</h4> Type hints in Python involve a colon and a type declaration after the first invocation of a name in a namespace.
            <h4>Type cast</h4> 
            <br>In Python, we can convert one type of variable to another type. This conversion is called type casting
            or type conversion.In casting, we convert variables declared in specific data types to the different data types.
            <h4>Unit test</h4>
            <br>
            Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of 
            source code are put under various tests to determine whether they are fit for use
            <h4>Static</h4>
            <br>
            Static means, that the member is on a class level rather on the instance level.
            Static variables exist only on class level and aren't instantiated.
            If you change a static variable in one instance of the class, the change will affect its value in all other instances.
            <h4>Class method</h4>
            <br>
            A class method is a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
             They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that 
             points to the class and not the object instance.
            <h4>Facade</h4>
            <br>
            Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a basic interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework. 
            While Facade decreases the overall complexity of the application, it also helps to move unwanted dependencies to one place.
            <br>
            <h4>Method</h4>
            <br> A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
            You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
            A function can return data as a result.
            <h4>Property</h4>
            <br> The property() function is used to define properties in the Python class. 
            The property() method in Python provides an interface to instance attributes.
            It encapsulates instance attributes and provides a property,
